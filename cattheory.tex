\\

\section{Practical Category Theory : David Koontz}
Monoids, SemiGroups
\\
\section{SemiGroup}
class Semigroup a where
\\
append :: $a$ $\rightarrow a \rightarrow a$
\\
Append is Associative
\\
$(a <> b) <> c == a <> (b <> c)$
\\
(A appended with B) appended with C 
\\
is the same as 
\\
A appended with (B appended with C)
\\
Monoid
\\
class (Semigroup a) <= Monoid a where 
\\
empty :: a 
\\
SemiGroup is append + associativity law
\\
Monoid is semigroup and it has an empty value
\\
\\
Monoid Laws
\\
The empty value doesn't change the meaning of a monoidal value
\\
a <> empty == a
\\
empty <> a == a
\\
(left and right identity)
\\
\\
\section{Higher Kinded Types : David Koontz}
Constraints
\\
Generic in structure
\\
\section{Functor}
f a
\\
Apply a function to the value(s) in the box
\\
map : Functor $f$ => $(a \rightarrow b) \rightarrow f$ $ a \rightarrow f$ $b$
\\
